# Adversarial-Attacks-and-Defense-Methods-for-DL-CE

## Problem Setup

DL-based techniques replacing traditional prediction algorithms in wireless systems. Communication is VERY security sensitive. 

## Project Scope

We develop novel adversarial attacks, and study defence methods on Deep Learning based channel estimation in wireless communications.

## Channel Estimation 

Channel estimation is the process of determining the effect of the physical communication channel on the signal sent from a transmitter to a receiver. We do channel estimation because channel introduces impairments that alter the signal's characteristics – attenuation, phase shift, multipath fading, doppler spread. The process of channel estimation is usually with pilot symbols + LS, MMSE, or Deep Learning.
